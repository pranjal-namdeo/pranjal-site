## What it is
AI Prompt Helper / Agent Prompt Engineer- 
A multi-agent system for designing, critiquing, and optimizing prompts and AI agent roles.

## Core Problem
Most developers:
- Use OpenAI / CrewAI / LangChain
- Get inconsistent outputs
- Don’t understand framing, constraints, or role design

## Tech Stack
- Python
- crewAI
- Ollama (local testing)
- OpenAI (real-world API key handling practice)
- CLI first
- FastAPI later (v2)

## Current status
In progress — building the core segmentation pipeline.

## Next steps
- Create evaluation set
- Normalize lighting
- Ship a small demo

## Why This Project Matters
This project:
- Improves every future agent I build
- Shows systems-level thinking
- Demonstrates LLM control understanding
- Is beginner-safe but architecturally impressive
- Becomes my internal AI engineering tool
